# VespaGPX

The Vespa iOS app lets you export all your data as a "JSON" file. Have you seen that file? It's a binary mess. Over at ModernVespa, people were wondering [how to actually get the data](https://modernvespa.com/forum/topic187938).  User [SteelBytes](https://modernvespa.com/members/steelbytes) cracked the code and has a [cool Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steelbytes.vespasnoop) to offer a ton of features and provide exports.  He gave me some tips on how to decode it the unreadable Vespa export.  A few weekend later, VespaGPX for iOS was born.  VespaGPX is not meant to replace the official Vespa iOS app...it just lets you export trips as GPX or CSV files.  You can throw the GPX exports at a cool visalization app (like [relive.cc](https://relive.cc)).

VespaGPX is open sourced, free, and does no tracking and maintains user privacy. Have an issue, file it! Have a solution, throw in a PR.
